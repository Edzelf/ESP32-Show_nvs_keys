# ESP32-Show_nvs_keys
Show all keys in ESP32 non volitile storage (NVS).

The NVS library is missing a function to list all keys (or a subset) present in the nvs.
For some programs however, it is vital to know which keys are present.
This demo shows all the keys in the NVS.

The logfile shows the output of the sketch while examining the preferences of ESP32Radio.
